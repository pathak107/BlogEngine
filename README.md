## Blogging Engine (BhootJs)
##### Inspired from Ghostjs and Wordpress blogging engine. This project is an attemp to make a blogging content management system (CMS) from scratch. The project is not a blog website instead it's intended for anyone to use and deploy easily to create their own blog website. 
##### Following plans are there for this project:
- A headless CMS rest API allowing users to create their own frontend without relying on the Engine.
- An Admin panel to configure the project for non technical users. 
- Razorpay payment gateway for premium content subscription
- Email list for newsletter feature
- Easily customizable API keys in config.json from admin panel for users add their own keys.
- Server side rendering for client side frontend. It will be done either with traditional html templates or nextJS.
 
#### Note: Project is at its very initial stage and not operational at all.
